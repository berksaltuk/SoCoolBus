# SoCoolBus
Bilkent University CS 491/2 Senior Project 2022/23
### Overview
As a group of five, we target to create a student-school bus tracking system named SoCoolBus that helps to inform parents about the location of their kids. By using SoCoolBus, parents can track their child’s status when they reach the school and home. Also see their location if the school bus is stuck in traffic, so they will not get anxious about their kid. Moreover, SoCoolBus helps bus drivers by allowing them to notify parents saying that “I am close to reach there, please be ready!” and time will not be wasted for both driver and the kid. Additionally, drivers will get the payments and control the payments by using SoCoolBus.
